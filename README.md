# Color-Gun
A discontinued project for my DigiPen Game Design class, 2020 - 2021.

While attending DigiPen, we have a required game design class that allows us to collaborate with our peers to create a game. We were limited to three people, including ourselves, per group, and had only three months to create a small game fit for multiple presentations. My team decided on creating a demo of what we really wanted in order to get used to working as a team instead of independently, the latter being what we were used to doing.

This is a scrapped demo. This repository includes revisions from all three of us, but I only commited it recently, as we used a different repository program to share between our computers.

The main concept of this game is to use different colored guns to destroy the respective enemies. ( i.e. green gun can only destroy green robot, blue gun can only destroy blue robot, etc. )
We played around with different assets and different mechanics, ultimnately having to create a small part of the engine in order to calculate where the ammo would go when the gun circles ( mouse movement around the player ) the character at various speeds ( while moving the player with arrow keys ).
